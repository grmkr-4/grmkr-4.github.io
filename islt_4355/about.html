<p style="text-indent: 25px;">
    Hey everybody, it's great meeting you all! My name is Grayson Mueller. I am a senior graduating in May. I am studying economics and business.
    My other areas of interest include technology, insurance, and analytics. I will be working towards completing a dual degree program in Kansas City.
    I want to use those degrees to become a data scientist. In relation to this course, I am new to web development and am an eager learner!
    HTML and CSS are important skills to have while working in the data analytics space. This class will help me create working websites and further
    build my portfolio. These websites will help me share my personal side projects with those who are interested and expand my network.
    Some of my outside hobbies include reading, working out, playing basketball, and watching my favorite show, King of Queens.
