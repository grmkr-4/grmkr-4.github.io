    Hey everybody, it's great meeting you all! My name is Grayson Mueller. I am a senior graduating in May. I am studying economics and business. My other interests areas are in tech, insurance, and analytics. I will be working towards completing a dual degree program in Kansas City. I want to use those degrees and become a data scientist. In relation to this course, I am new to web development and am an eager learner! HTML/CSS are import skills to have while working in the data analytics space. This class will help me create working websites and further build my portfolio. These websites will help me share my personal side projects to those interested and expand my network. Some of my outside hobbies include reading, working-out, basketball, and watching my favorite show (King of Queens).
