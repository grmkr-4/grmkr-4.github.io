  <h4>How I Started:</h4>
  <br>
    <p class="para1">
      How I first found out about data anayltics and data science was through my first couple internships.
      I wasn't exactly sure what I should expect at the beginning because I was still relatively new. However, I quickly found out that there is so 
      many new and exciting things to learn within these areas! Not only are the deliverables from analytics so powerful and intriguing but data analysis
      can also be apppicable to so many field. This is what I enjoy the most about data.
    </p><br>
     
    <h4>Current Status:</h4>
  <br>
    <p class="indent"> 
      I am currently in my last year of undergrad at the University of Missouri. This last semester I am finishing up my analytics and IT curriculumn
      as well as applying to graduate school. Here I hope to dive deeper into data science and continue to develop my expertise in predictive analytics.
      This summer I hope to take part in another analytics internship within the St.Louis area. I hope to learn from industry professionals and further 
      prepare me for my masters program.
   </p><br>
     
   <h4>What I have Learned:</h4>
  <br>
   <p class="indent"> 
     During my time of undergrad, I have taken a broad range of classes and all of which help me prepare to become a succesful analyst. My curriculum has
     coverred areas such as Economics, Analytics, and IT to name a few. These courses have taught me so many useful skills and tools. R, Python, and SQL 
     are a few of the tools I have learned that I believe to be the most useful!
    </p><br>
     
   <h4>Where I want to be:</h4>
  <br>
    <p class="indent">
      I am very excited to be attending graduate school and look forward to starting that next chapter in my life. As for post-grad studies, I have ambtions
      of becoming a data scientist and working within the insurance. I hope to work on a team with other like-minded and analytical thinkers in quanitative 
      and preditive modeling. I want to use my newly learned skills and bring machine learning to the realm of insurance!
