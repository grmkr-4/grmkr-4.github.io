  <h4>How I Started:</h4>
    <p class="para1">
      How I first found out about data anayltics and data science was through my first couple internships.
      I wasn't exactly sure what I should expect at the beginning because I was still relatively new. However, I quickly found out that there is so 
      many new and exciting things to learn within these areas! Not only are the deliverables from analytics so powerful and intriguing but data analysis
      can also be apppicable to so many field. This is what I enjoy the most about data.
    </p><br>
     
    <h4>Current Status:</h4>
    <p class="indent"> 
      I am currently in my last year of undergrad at the University of Missouri. This last semester I am finishing up my analytics and IT curriculumn
      as well as applying to graduate school. Here I hope to dive deeper into data science and continue to develop my expertise in predictive analytics.
      This summer I hope to take part in another analytics internship within the St.Louis area. I hope to learn from industry professionals and further 
      prepare me for my masters program.
   </p><br>
     
   <h4>What I have Learned:</h4>
   <p class="indent"> 
     During my time of undergrad, I have taken a broad range of classes and all of which help me prepare to become a succesful analyst. My curriculum has
     coverred areas such as Economics, Analytics, and IT to name a few. These courses have taught me so many useful skills and tools. R, Python, and SQL 
     are a few of the tools I have learned that I believe to be the most useful!
    </p><br>
     
   <h4>Where I want to be:</h4>
    <p class="indent">
      I am very excited to be attending graduate school and look forward to starting that next chapter in my life. As for post-grad studies, I have ambtions
      of becoming a data scientist and working within the insurance. I hope to work on a team with other like-minded and analytical thinkers in quanitative 
      and preditive modeling. I want to use my newly learned skills and bring machine learning to the realm of insurance!

  <h4>How I got here</h4>
    <p class="para1">
      At the onset of my program, I harbored uncertainty regarding the ADDIE process and its fundamental phases. Although I was keen on
      pursuing a career in L&D as an instructional designer, my experience in writing objectives and creating courses was limited. Nevertheless,
      the course of my program has transformed my proficiency in the field and I am excited to learn more.
    </p><br>
 
    <h4>Where I am in my Program</h4>
    <p class="indent"> 
       I am halfway through my program and I am thrilled by the progress made thus far. My portfolio of artifacts serves as a testament to my professional
       growth and development in becoming an instructional designer. Although the learning process involved in creating these artifacts has been 
       enjoyable, it has not always been easy. At times, I have found myself outside my comfort zone, striving to find balance amidst the challenges 
       and setbacks I have encountered. However, I persevered and overcoming these obstacles has been worthwhile.
   </p><br>
 
 
   <h4>What I have Learned</h4>
   <p class="indent"> 
      The program has equipped me with hands-on experience working through each phase of the ADDIE lifecycle, conducting Front-End analysis,
      identifying knowledge gaps, and designing and conducting formative and summative assessments/evaluations. Additionally, I have gained a
      solid understanding of adult learning theory and the ability to write objectives using Backwards Design to ensure the alignment of 
      learning strategies with objectives and assessments. With each course,I am gradually but surely becoming an informed instructional designer.
       Equipped with the basic tools, knowledge, and know-how needed to create professional courses.
    </p><br>
 
  
   <h4>Where I am going</h4>
    <p class="indent">
      I am eagerly looking forward to completing the remaining half of my program, building on the foundation laid by the courses taken thus far, 
      and honing my professional skills. My goal is to become an instructional designer. After graduation, I hope to secure a position in a large 
      corporation which will allow me to work on a design team. There I will be able transfer the skills I have gained in throughout my program,
       and work with my collegues to design and develop impactful eLearning materials that drive real-world results. While proud of the work accomplished 
       so far, I am excited about my future and the opportunities that lie ahead.
